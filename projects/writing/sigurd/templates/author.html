    <h3>Sigurd Vidarsson</h3>
    <p>
        I write about the cold north of my old home and my imagined underground of glass jungle in my new home, Singapore. I like any bit of fantasy, especially if it is twisted and a little dark. Everything of mine is rooted in a sense of place, culture, and history. I love to work with Norse mythology, and I'm starting to play with the mythologies of Southeast Asia.

        My biggest work is the Odinsbane saga. You can find the first 10 pages on the Odinsbane page on this site. I've written the first book, and I seek agent representation. Please feel free to contact me about such and other opportunities on sigurd.vidarsson@gmail.com.
    </p>

        You can find the best of my smaller writings on this site. I also post under the Reddit handle HermitHuldrekall, usually seeking feedback before posting the finished versions here.

        Beyond writing, I spend my days crunching numbers and trading the stock market for my day job. I also like to think I am a passable software developer, as I made this site with AWS and Django. On my remaining spare time, I like to play tennis, brew my own beer, and paint after Bob Ross' old videos.
    </p>
    <p>
        That's about me. You have come to the place where I express myself. Please let yourself be entertained.
